the gui has to link to the main game loop. this will be achieved by introducing the main loop into the main script.
All compontent to the gui will be inherited from the gui file.

StringVar ect will be created in the GUI class and the object imported to the the main game loop  class where the can
link to a player instance. This wil most likley be in the form of function that takes the parameters of a player
instance and String/IntVar instances. This function is to be run at the start of a player turn.
