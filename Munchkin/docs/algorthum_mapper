main_gui reports(sets vars) to gui_var script and engine get all variables from gui var script
thus main_gui imports gui_var and engine imports gui_var. gui can then call the classes of engine without moving any variables
or changing the self parameter


######################################################
# GUI considerations
######################################################

Controller:
    Controller serves up pages(frames) that are raised to the top.
    These are pre-build at the beginning
    An update method is required that binds all tk.Vars to gameVar scrip (updated from player model)


Pages:
    start page-
        welcomes with start button that progresses to options toplevel

    options-
        sets game options in gui_variables.py.Options.  These will be game flags for certain activities
        modal infobox detailing changes on conformation button press

    player select-
        spin box with player select. textvariable = num_of_players
        button leads to player details playersetter method
        playersetter-
            num_of_players = IntVar() binds to 2 variables in gameVar -
                1) gameVar.StartVariables.new_players that manipulates label in Toplevel
                2) gameVar.StartVariables.player_rand that drives the index for the instances in the list during selection


        PlayerInfo:
            provides a  generic player name with a box to enter name and gender
            button to confirm either moves to another player name/gender or starts game loop
            Information required:
                method to check num of players
                link to game var to bind plays name/gender
                call of method in engine to bind attribs to the correct player
                possible yield loop that takes player instance
                order:
                    while new_players =>1
                    box pops up.
                    player inputs info
                    button is pushed

                        calls player method
                        for each instance (in order) from Maxplayers
                            fetches gui_variables and binds to player
                            yields player

                    calls next() method


for main play window the gui must have the gamevars ready linking to the instance in question. button will change the
instance associated

mainloop class to define a method to send index to game_loop class.

game_Loop.py
    Game_loop.py main directive is to either source logic from other classes, provide one shot logic demanded by the
    GUI and primarily to update gui_variables.py  that can be accessed by controller.py

        Main class: PlayerSetup:
            rand method:
                usees random choice function from the random module.
                picks a random player instance from the generated active_players list
                send result to verbinding method.

            varbinding method:
                accepts parameter of a player instance
                uses instance to bind all player attributes to gameVar


    before MainLoop is called all tkVar need to be set up. this is handled by the controller by the method update_frame.
    At the end of Playerinfo class method test, game_loop will use index to determine the correct player in gameVar.active_players.
    indexed player will bind self to gameVar.player_atribs.x
    controller.Main class binds self.x to StringVar()
    Main.update_frame method binds all player attributes to tk Variables and the gameVar script
    This update method must be called to refresh/concurrent the labels in the play area



#######################################################################
# Game start and options methods
#######################################################################
deatails method for start page and game options

controller.StartPg, class
    Presents two options start or options
    - start button will call controller.show_frame(PlayerSelect) so that number of players can be selected from the spinbox
    - options button will call toplevel GameOptions class

start button
    controller.show_frame(PlayerSelect)
        See player rotation method detailed in independent section bellow

GameOptions, toplevel
    presents options that change gameVar.Options that act as flags for specific in game methods
    Defaults are set in gameVar. Options for are:
        gameVar.Options.cards_delt = self.inital_deal.get()     # number of each type of card to deal on start
        gameVar.Options.win_lvl = self.maxlvl.get()             # level needed to win game
        gameVar.Options.perm_death = self.permadeath.get()      # game death permanency
        gameVar.Options.carry_weight = self.carry_weight.get()  # number of cards that can be placed in sack
    'Ok' button calls method setopts(self)

    setopts(self), method
        Fetches all tk variables and binds to all gameVar variables.
        creates a message variable with all f-string of all new values
        messagebox.showinfo(title,contents) is called
        messagebox.showinfo("Settings Changed!", message) is called highlighting the changes

    GameOptions.destroy(self), tk.method
        toplevel with options is destroyed after acknowledging messagebox

controller.StartPg
player can now either re-enter options of press start

#######################################################################
# Name/gender, random player to start and deal starting set of cards

Details method for setting name/gender, random player to start and deal initial cards

PlayerSelect(), class
    creates spinbox with textvariable=self.Num_of_players bound to tk.IntVar()
    and Confirm Button that calls self.playersetter method

    playersetter, method
        gameVar.StartVariables.new_players = self.Num_of_players.get()
            pulls the number of selected players from the spinbox and binds to gameVar new_players
            This is the number of players wanted in the current game.

        gameVar.StartVariables.player_rand = self.Num_of_players.get()
            Binds player_rand to Num_of_players also.

        engine.select_players(), method
            method is used to slice total available players with the number of players wanted then call deal_handler() to
            provide cards to all players in session.

            num_of_players = gameVar.StartVariables.new_players
            actual players named session_players which is then stored in gameVar.
                This is used to slice available_players list into a list of
                gameVar.StartVariables.session_players = gameVar.StartVariables.players_available[:num_of_players]

            deal_handler("start"), method
            Flexible method created to deal cards either at start, after death or specific cards (door/treasure).
            player.unsorted = cards.card_sop.deal_cards("start", gameVar.Options.cards_dealt)
                Used to issue cards to all players. "start" parameter is used to define the the type of deal wanted.
                This then loops over the players in session_players calling cards.card_sop.deal_cards() table.py

                cards.card_sop.deal_cards("start", gameVar.Options.cards_dealt)
                    Calls Table class and the card method card_sop for the Dealer class (a table has-a Dealer) with the
                    method deal_cards. The arguments "start" and ameVar.Options.cards_dealt specify the mode of deal
                    through the branch and the number of each card to deal laid out by the game options respectively.
                    Card selection fo each type is randomised through the use of Random module.
                    Cards are stored in the variable starter_set and returned to caller and bound to player.unsorted.
                    This is a list of cards that associates to the individual player

        PlayerInfo(), toplevel
            Complex script to create a arbitrary name tag with incrementation number, set the name and gender of
            the player, generate a random player to start and structure a game loop that loops over session_players.

                class had 2 class variables:
                    counter = 1  #  player identity title number for arbitrary label
                    indexing = 0 # index to access correct player instance in session_players list and ensures
                    details are bound to the correct player instance.
                    note a 3rd is used but located in gameVar (new_players) set by the playersetter method above.

                Players enter their details and press "confirm" button that triggers initial_set (return button does
                same thing).

                    number = gameVar.StartVariables.new_players

                initial_set, method
                    Branch is created for checking the number of players in gameVar.StartVariables.new_players assigned
                    to the variable name = number. Each time this method is called it reduces number by 1 ensuring that
                    the final entry is the last to redraw the toplevel window. (number -= 1)

                    PlayerInfo.counter += 1 is used to increase the number for the arbitrary player label

                    gameVar.PlayerAtribs.player_name = self.instname.get()
                    gameVar.PlayerAtribs.player_gender = self.instgender.get()
                    Both bind the player attribs provided to the player name in gameVar
                    engine.player_name_gender(PlayerInfo.indexing) is then called

                    engine.player_name_gender(PlayerInfo.indexing), engine class method
                        player = gameVar.StartVariables.session_players[playerindex]
                            class indexing variable is used to pass to player_name_gender method to access the correct
                            player in session_players.
                            player is now a specific player instance

                        player.char_setup() method is called to set and bind attrribs to players

                        player.char_setup(), method
                            calls P_tools.name() and xy = P_tools.name()
                            return value of each is set as a player attribute
                            if the return val is == to the dev mode other attribs will be attributed to the player

                            P_tools.name()
                                x = gameVar.PlayerAtribs.player_name
                                returns name stored in gameVar with title method
                                or dev mode name if criteria met

                            P_tools.name()
                            x = gameVar.PlayerAtribs.player_gender
                            return x.title()

                    PlayerInfo.indexing = PlayerInfo.indexing + 1 is increased for the next player when passed back into
                    engine.player_name_gender(self, playerindex)    NOTE: index == playerindex as it becomes method argument
                    PlayerInfo.destroy(self) is called to destroy the toplevel window
                    gameVar.StartVariables.new_players = number changes the number new_players in gameVar to the new
                    decreased number.

                        Inner loop triggered if number not equal to 0 triggering toplevel to rebuild with the new
                        arbitrary counter label increasing.

                        When the condition runs that the number is == 0, the integer in new_players list has reached
                        zero. This will destroy the toplevel PlayerInfo permanently and trigger the next sequence of
                        events.

                        engine.rand(), method
                            method for selecting a player from the session_players to go first with the use of the
                            random module - player = choice(gameVar.StartVariables.session_players).
                            This method then calls varbinding(player), a method specifically for binding the player
                            attributes to gameVar.
                            Importantly gameVar active_player is named: gameVar.StartVariables.active_player = player
                            used later in turn based assignment

                            varbinding(player) method
                                Binds all player attributes to gameVar.PlayerAtribs. Note this method can take in any
                                player instance and bind to gameVar.PlayerAtribs.

                        app.update_frame(), method
                            part of controller.py class Main method that acts as the controller. Sets all tk.Vars with
                            gameVar.PlayerAtribs. Act like a refresh for new bindings from varbinding that impacts upon
                            MainLoop frame that calls controller.atrib. method also changes size of the Main window
                            ready for gameplay.

                        app.show_frame(MainLoop), method
                            Raises MainLoop to the forefront

#######################################################################
# player rotation method, (initial start and game progression)
#######################################################################
Setting player rotation method and binding attributes. In previous section varbinding(player) and update_frame()
set the player info to the random selected player. This is detailed in the player info to the left on the screen and
goes first in the game. End turn button should trigger events that lead to the next player and the update of the
player info window.

    end_turn, button method
    On button press player turn ends and another begins.
        engine.player_order(gameVar.StartVariables.active_player) active_player bound in rand method above becomes
        current_player. while play is true (to be set as conditional for gameVar.Options.win_lvl) creates loop for
        players in game. With the use of itertools cycle is used to iterate over the session_players
        player_gen = cycle(gameVar.StartVariables.session_players). next is called to yield next player and loop back
        to the beginning of the list.

        within the while loop there is a branch. current_player is compared to next(player_gen) that is called y.
        If the conditional in not met  current_player == y next is called again until current_player is found == y.
        When this happens there are 2 outcomes either the player is alive or the player is dead.

        In the event of alive gameVar.active_player is updated to next(player_gen) thus next in line to play. varbinding
        is called with the new player argument gameVar.active_player. The loop is then broken preventing endless recursion.

        Death and its conditionals will be addressed later.

        app.update_frame(), method
        method again updates the player info to the left of the screen

# sell method
#######################################################################

Sell method uses code re-usability to the max with shortened functions that allow various usage buy numerous callers.
The end goal is to remove items from the player adding them to the burn pile and gaining profit from the sale.

    Mainloop the sell (sell_list) button-
        From controller.Mainloop the sell button calls sell_list.
        sell_list first calls scrub_lists. This important as all linked lists ar appended and not built anew.
        calls player from active_player in gameVar

        Player has method called item_by_key. This takes 1 argument 'sell' defined as key on other end
        (but could be anything specific from a game card)
        item_by_key(self, key) generates a list from all cards in player.unsorted (a list of cards delt to the player during
        controller.PlayerSelect.playersetter during player slice) that are specific in the fact they have in card dictionary
        a key called 'sell'. Under list comprehension this generates a list of only sellable objects in the player deck.
        this list is binded to gameVar.GameObjects.selected items.

        Returning to controller, OwnedItems(window_title) Toplevel is now called with the arg "Sellable Items".
        OwnedItems loops over objects in selected_items creating a list format each with a name,type,value and a checkbox.
        ** consider adding info buttion that either raise the pic of the card or text description.
        gameVar.GameObjects.check_but_intvar_gen.append(status) is also build per item and bound to checkbutton changing
        independently with checkbutton activity.
        The id of each card is appended to a new list in gameVar.GameObjects.check_but_card_ids.
        This order is the same order as Checkbutton object in the other list.
        The button is use to call sell method

    sell button -
    engine.zipper() # passes string arg for card_matcher (method acts as conduit)
        Calls engine.zipper method (generic method for zipping 2 list together into a tuple)
        gameVar.GameObjects.zipped_tup.clear() is called to ensure list is clear.
        First step required is the conversion of the Checkbutton objects to the boolean value (0 or 1) from
        gameVar.GameObjects.check_but_intvar_gen, a list of all tk Vars, associated to the check button, requiring .get method.
        This creates new list of booleans called gameVar.GameObjects.check_but_boo consisting of the boolean values.
        x, y = gameVar.GameObjects.check_but_card_ids, gameVar.GameObjects.check_but_boo
        gameVar.GameObjects.zipped_tup = list(zip(x, y)) function is to zip cards independent ids to their bool.
        This creates tuple pairs of (id,0/1) for each card in gameVar.GameObjects.selected items.
        engine.card_matcher(action) is then called.

    engine.card_matcher(action) CREATED FOR FLEXIBILITY OF INPUTS AND FORWARD PASS
        creates loop for each card in gameVar.GameObjects.selected_items that iterates over cards then
        creates an inner loop or tup in gameVar.GameObjects.zipped_tup for each card, NOTE:tup contains (card id, 0or1).
        Conditional if tup[0] == card["id"] and tup[1] filters the cards by matching ids (tup[0]) and only if the
        tup[1] value is == 1 (True).
        After qualification a branch is created calling the correct method associated to action parameter, in this case "sell"
        the qualifying card is passed to sell_item(self, card).

        sell_item(self, card)
            player wallet is substituted with the card value and the card is popped form the
            player unsorted list and cards.add_to_burn(x) is called.

            cards.(self, discard) method -
            x = self.unsorted.pop(self.unsorted.index(card)) # pops card from player unsorted deck
            cards.add_to_burn(x) # popped item is used as arg
                simple method that adds cards to the burn pile that have been remove from the game. note simple arg of the card
                to be removed

    OwnedItems.destroy(self)
        destroys toplevel with sellable items listed

    engine.scrub_lists()
        Critical for appended lists.
        calls scrub_list from engine resetting all appendable lists: selected_items, check_but_intvar_gen, check_but_boo,
        check_but_card_ids and zipped_tup. This reset allows new creation when recalled or new player.

    rebinding variables
    engine.varbinding(gameVar.StartVariables.active_player)
    app.update_frame()
        updates the player info screen detailing changes to player wallet

# Equipping method
##########################################################################
Accessed by either weapons or armour buttons.
MainLoop, class
    Armor, Main screen button - calls list_armor method

    list_armor, method:
        gameVar.GameObjects.message & app.update_message("show") - Call simple message to the main window

        engine.scrub_lists() - clears all lists ready for new item stack

        player.inventory("type", "armor") - builds a list of all weapons from the unsorted list to contain only armor
            This list is bound to gameVar.selected_items. Note that this meth take two params as it is looking for a
            specific key val pair. Note cards have "type":"armor" arrangement in the card dict.

        OwnedItems("Armor Owned", "armor") - TopLevel call with params for title other for button layout specific to armor.

    OwnedItems(title, set_but) - Toplevel, Window is build with title and specific set of buttons for armor cards.
        Buttons include: sell (method as above), Equip (This focus).

        equip - button method
                engine.zipper("equip"), method -  See sell meth for action (brief - takes selected_items list and bools
                from checkbox to make. Calls card_matcher)

                card_matcher(action), method - See sell , (brief - id matches cards with the unsorted. The tuples return
                    True to yield cards that can be used). The action parameter defines what happens to the card next).

                    tri_qualifier(card), method - For any card to be equipped it must be checked to ensure that it is suited
                        to the player in respects of race, class and gender. This is required as some cards have restrictions
                        who can use them. (This is an updated meth that does away with the a fractured 3 method approach).
                        Uses dict of key vals to loop over player and card. First card is checked for any restrictions,
                        if none exist the loop is exited resulting in the card being passed to the next method.
                        If the card contains a restriction it is compared to the player. In the event the player does not
                        qualify, the cards remains in the unsorted list unequipped. A flag is used to control passage.
                        ############## small bug name can be r and still qualify if no gender set #######################
                        If qualified, card_designator(player, card) is called passing the card and player along.

                        card_designator(self, player, card), method
                            small method for distinguishing between weap and armor cards that then call the appropriate method
                            based on card type. in the case of armor: equip_armor is called from the player class

                            equip_armor(self, card)














PREBUILD CONSIDERATIONS PLAN
consider changing card to fit ie equip:True then loop over for equipped items. good to detrmine bonuses, use re for
status effects/qualifiers. name of equipped item for player info = verbinding can call meth that returns it or none

need to set up vars in Main
access to them
separate player list for equipped/curse/status effects
method to select equipable items and populate selected_items
way to screen items dependent on player ie for dewarfs only ect

stepes needed:::
way to screen cards race/gender... same for cursing??

way to add to player or check if place is occupied already and remove player and add to sack

# remove items
#######################################################################
action =  engine,zipper("remove")>
requires a search if player assets as no items will show in top level as they have been removed.
